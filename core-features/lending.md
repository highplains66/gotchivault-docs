# Lending

One of the features we think provides the most value to depositors is our ability to safely automate the lending process on your behalf.

We have integrated the Aavegotchi lending contracts into the Gotchi Vault contracts, which allows us to list all of the aavegotchis in the vault on the lending market at aavegotchi.com.  Unless users opt out of this process by "pausing" their rental, we will be using bots to constantly monitor the gotchis in the Vault to determine whether they need to be listed, whether the listing needs to be modified or cancelled, and whether a rental has concluded and needs to be ended and re-listed.

_**Pausing**_

If you don't want any of your gotchis to be lent out, you can go into our UI's "Management Mode", select the gotchis you don't want to lend, and click "Pause Selected".  This triggers an on-chain transaction indicating these gotchis shouldn't be lent out.  If your gotchi is mid-rental, you'll have to wait for that rental to conclude, but your gotchi then won't be re-listed.  You can always un-pause that gotchi, by triggering the "Resume Selected" transaction.

_**Locking and guild rental**_

Regarding rentals, we have partnerships with a number of large guilds, like Crypto Gaming United, Blackpool, Orium, and Metanerd.  We have agreed to whitelist aavegotchis to these guilds.  For this to work smoothly and predictably, however, we need to ensure that the gotchis we allocate to the guilds stay in the vault for a period of time.  We're asking users to lock up their gotchis for a set period of time, during which your gotchi will be lent out to the guilds (presumably at a much higher utilization than you'd receive on the public market!).  You can lock your gotchi for a period of time using the UI.  **NOTE** that once you lock your gotchi it is **REALLY** locked for that period of time.  You will not be able to withdraw until the lock period has ended.

_**Fees**_

As lending in the Gotchiverse is brand new, we will monitor closely the market dynamics to see what the most competitive and optimal rental profit splits are.  On day 1, we'll be renting out our gotchis at a 60/30/10 split: 60% for the player, 30% for the owner, and 10% for the Vault (this 10% will be divided, as with all fees, between vGHST holders, the Vault Managers, and the vault creators/dev team).  We will also charge a 1 GHST initial cost, to ensure that renters don't borrow the gotchis and not use them.

_**Custom settings**_

In the coming days and weeks, we'll be adding more features to the user interface, allowing you to take more control over how your gotchis are lended out!
