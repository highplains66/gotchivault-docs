# Gotchi Vault

[Aavegotchi](https://aavegotchi.com) is a state of the art DeFi/NFT/metaverse/play-to-earn project operating on the Polygon network. If you’re new to Aavegotchi, we highly recommend reading through the [Introductory](https://wiki.aavegotchi.com/en/introduction) page on the Wiki.

One of the most common comments I hear when onboarding new users to the Aavegotchi universe is “there’s so much to do here, I don’t have time to actively manage all these assets.”

That’s where the **GotchiVault** comes in, which aims to be a fully decentralized, permissionless asset manager for the Aavegotchi ecosystem. With the **GotchiVault**, new and existing members of the Aavegotchi community can deposit their **$GHST** and Aavegotchis into a permissionless contract, where these assets will be securely managed by veteran community members, with the goal to optimize $GHST yield for all participants.
